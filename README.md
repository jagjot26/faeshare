## Inspiration

I developed this fullstack social media web app because I wanted to hone my knowledge of the MERN stack along with Next.js. Initially, I decided to go with Next's default server option. Then, I discarded that and went with the custom Express server since that allowed me to use WebSockets (Socket.io in my case) in my app for realtime chats. Besides this, this is a simple social media web app. You can create a post, like it, follow other users, comment on posts, delete your post or comment, and so on and so forth. You can try it out here : https://faeshare.in. For quick testing, you may use these credentials- email: srk@example.com, password: 123456

Please give this repository a ⭐ if you liked this app. It seems like a little thing, but it helps a lot with the motivation.
